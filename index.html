                I am just beginning my career as a developer, I am still in school and learning a lot. I have worked in the software world previously as a
                Quality Assurance Associate at Hyland Software. While I was there I developed skills with SQL and working with databases directly. I also
                have a lot of experience with debugging and resolving issues.

                On a more personal note, I have two amazing dogs, Mikey, a border collie mix and Tia, a pitbull mix. 
                I love to travel, to cook, and to go horseback riding.
                Animals are one of my passions, and I try to spend some of my free time voluntering with rescue horses.
                My boyfriend and I love hiking and the mountains, so we do hope to be able to move out west soon.
                This is one of the many reasons I hope to be able to find a remote job opportunity.
